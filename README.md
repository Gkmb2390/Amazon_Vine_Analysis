Using Colab, Postgresql and ETL techniques to analyze large data sets. 

# Core Questions

One of the key questions asked about our data sets refrains to the number of reviews posted by both users and non users of vine.  After breaking down the data we are able to see within the dataset that I had selected there were 613 total reviews from Vine users; while non-vine users equated to just shy of 65K(64,968).
